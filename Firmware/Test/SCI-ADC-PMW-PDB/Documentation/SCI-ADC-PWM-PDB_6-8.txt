Module "ADC0"      (component Init_ADC_56800)
   - ADC0_Init -This method initializes registers of the ADC module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

                see <Call Init method> property of the component for more details.

Module "PWMC1"     (component PWMMC)
   - PWMC1_Enable -Enable the component - it starts the signal generation. Events can be disabled/enabled by 
                <DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>.
   - PWMC1_Disable -Disable the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. When the timer is disabled, it is 
                still possible to call method <SetOutput> to control the output value on corresponding pin.
   - PWMC1_SetDuty -Setting duty (value) register(s) of selected channel. The value is loaded after calling <Load> method.   [ 
                Version specific information for Freescale 56800/E and HC08 and HCS12 and HCS12X derivatives ]   Setting is 
                valid for actual speed mode only, initial value is restored after speed mode change.   [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800/E derivatives - eFlexPWM device ]   Duty register(s) value is not affected 
                during speed mode change. It should be handled by the user code.
   - PWMC1_Load -Apply last setting of the methods <SetDuty>, <SetDutyPercent>, both <SetRatio*>, <SetPeriod> and 
                <SetPrescaler>.
   - PWMC1_OutputPadEnable -Method enables output pads.
   - PWMC1_OutputPadDisable -Method disables output pads.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the send and receive functions. Events may be generated 
                ("DisableEvent"/"EnableEvent").
   - AS1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops the send and receive functions. No events will be generated.
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can 
                be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication 
                using DMA.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA 
                controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this 
                method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method returns the number of characters in the transmit buffer.
