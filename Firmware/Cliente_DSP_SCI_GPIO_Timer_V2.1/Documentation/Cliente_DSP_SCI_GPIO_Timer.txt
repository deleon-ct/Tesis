Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "RTS_Signal" (component BitIO)
   - RTS_Signal_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - RTS_Signal_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - RTS_Signal_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - RTS_Signal_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - RTS_Signal_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can 
                be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication 
                using DMA.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA 
                controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this 
                method returns the number of characters in the receive buffer.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  
                If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA controller then 
                this method returns the number of characters in the transmit buffer.
   - AS1_TurnTxOn -Turns on the transmitter. This method is available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_TurnTxOff -Turns off the transmitter. This method is available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_TurnRxOn -Turns on the receiver. This method is available only if the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_TurnRxOff -Turns off the receiver. This method is available only if the receiver property is enabled.
